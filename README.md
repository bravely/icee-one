Icee One Expanded Tests
=======================

Hi Juliana! So, this repo has two files- index.js and morning.js.

Morning.js has everything from our coderpad this morning, including the
background on the problem.

What you want to do is go into index.js and begin uncommenting the tests one by
one, making each work before you move onto the next. You'll do this by matching
creating the function the test is calling, and make what it returns the
equivalent of the other half of the test.

To run the uncommented tests, you can just use `npm test` from the command line.
